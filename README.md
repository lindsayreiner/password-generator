Deployed webpage: https://lindsayreiner.github.io/password-generator/

## Motivation

- Employer needed a password generator for all employees handling PII, and other sensitive information.

## Problems Solved Using JavaScript

- Added an event listener for when the user clicks the generate password button.

- Set up window prompts to confirm password criteria.

- Created variables for all possible password characters

- Tested variables against users responses to confirm messages using if statements.

- All fixes done without changing the overall look of the page.

## Lessons Learned

- Learned how to use EventListeners.

- Learned how to create pop up messages to either make an alert, a prompt that requires a response or a confirm for a boolean response.

- How to use a for loop to generate a desired output.
